# Crunch Digital RPG
Crunch is a fully digital tabletop RPG system engineered from the ground up for Foundry VTT. Unlike traditional TTRPGs limited by human-speed math and physical constraints, Crunch leverages your computer’s processing power to deliver gameplay mechanics that were previously impossible.

Combat, movement, and stats are no longer abstracted—they're simulated. Dynamic character data updates in real time, influenced by dozens of interconnected factors. Classic initiative and grid systems are replaced with fluid, real-time action queuing and precise 360° positioning. Environmental effects, modifiers, and conditions cascade and interact seamlessly, all handled under the hood so players can focus on strategy, not spreadsheets.
By embracing a digital-native design, Crunch supports features that would collapse a paper system:

- Real-time stat recalculations

- Spatial and temporal combat physics

- Persistent, intelligent condition tracking

- Multi-layered environmental logic

- Three-dimensional momentum and movement modeling

Crunch turns the complexity dial to eleven—then quietly lets the engine do the math.

## Status
